#### Overview

This program reveals the entire map and increases the maximum camera zoom in Path of Exile. This is as simple as it gets - just a maphack and a zoomhack. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Just double-click and you're done.

#### Features

- Full map revealed on area load.
- Maximum camera zoom increased by 50%.
- No modifications to game memory.
- No open handles to the game.
- No admin privileges required.
- No fumbling with Cheat Engine tables required.
- **Works with Steam and standard clients.**
- **64-bit client only.**

#### Disclaimer

Cheating is bad. Using this program is against the game's terms of use. This is currently not detected; however, the anti-cheat could be changed to detect this. I will not be adding more anti-detection over time. **There is always a risk.**

#### Instructions

1. Start the game.
2. Double-click on *exmap.exe*. You do not need to run it as an administrator.
3. The maphack will be automatically activated.

**If you are using the popular technique of running Path of Exile as a limited user account, you will need to run exmap with that same user account or as administrator.**
