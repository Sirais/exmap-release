#### Overview

This program reveals the entire map and increases the maximum camera zoom in Path of Exile. This is as simple as it gets - just a maphack and a zoomhack. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Just double-click and you're done.

#### Features

- Full map revealed on area load.
- Maximum camera zoom increased by 50%.
- No modifications to game memory.
- No open handles to the game.
- No admin privileges required.
- No fumbling with Cheat Engine tables required.
- **Works with Steam and standard clients only.**
- **64-bit client only.**

#### Disclaimer

Cheating is bad. Using this program is against the game's terms of use. This is currently not detected; however, the anti-cheat could be changed to detect this. I will not be adding more anti-detection over time. **There is always a risk.**

#### Instructions

1. Start the game.
2. Double-click on *exmap.exe*. You do not need to run it as an administrator.
3. The maphack will be automatically activated.

**Do you run Path of Exile as a limited user? If so, you also need to do the following:**
- **You *must* run the maphack and the game as the same user.**
- **You *must* allow the game to access the folder that exmaplib.dll is in.**
- **Doing this does not make it easier to detect the maphack.**

#### Common Issues

**I get error code EE: 0xA0000003 LE: 5 when I try to run the maphack.**
See the instructions above. This is usually because you are not running the maphack using the exact same user that the game is running with. You need to run them as the same user. You also need to make sure the game can access the folder where the maphack is saved.

**I get dropped from the server if I load the maphack when I'm already in game.**
The maphack will essentially pause the game while it waits for you to click OK after seeing the success message. If you wait too long to do this and you're already in-game, the server may disconnect you because of a timeout.
