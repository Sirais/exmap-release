#### Overview

This program reveals the entire map and increases the maximum camera zoom in Path of Exile. This is as simple as it gets - just a maphack and a zoomhack. It's designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Just double-click and you're done.

#### Features

- Full map revealed on area load.
- Maximum camera zoom increased by 50%.
- No modifications to game memory.
- No open handles to the game.
- No admin privileges required.
- No fumbling with Cheat Engine tables required.
- **Works with Steam and standard clients only.**
- **64-bit client only.**

#### Disclaimer

Cheating is bad. Using this program is against the game's terms of use. This is currently not detected; however, the anti-cheat could be changed to detect this. I will not be adding more anti-detection over time. **There is always a risk.**

#### Instructions

1. Start the game.
2. Double-click on *exmap.exe*. You do not need to run it as an administrator.
3. The maphack will be automatically activated.

**If you are using the popular technique of running Path of Exile as a limited user account, you must run the maphack as the same limited user. This is safe to do. It will not affect how detectable the maphack is. If you have problems running exmap with the default settings, you can try this alternate loading method starting in version 2.2:**

You'll need to create a shortcut to the *exmap.exe* file.

1. Right-click on *exmap.exe* and click *Create shortcut*.
2. Right-click on the newly created shortcut and click *Properties*.
3. In the text box that says *Target*, add ` -alt` after `exmap.exe`. Example: `C:\some\path\exmap.exe -alt`.
4. Save the shortcut.

From now on, you should double-click on this shortcut instead to run the maphack. Remember that you still need to be running the maphack as the same limited user as the game, if you use the limited user method. If you still have trouble after completing these steps, try right clicking and selecting *Run as administrator*.
